# RectEXIFyer

**Preserve your composition. Fix your aspect ratio. Show your EXIF.**

RectEXIFyer is a small, focused tool for photographers who are tired of sacrificing their image composition just to satisfy social media aspect ratios.

Originally built for my own workflow with Fujifilm cameras – now available for everyone.

## What problem does RectEXIFyer solve?

Social media platforms like Instagram enforce strict image aspect ratios (1:1, 4:5, etc.).  
Most photos, however, are composed differently.

The usual result:
- cropping important parts of the image
- destroying the original composition
- compromises you didn’t plan to make

RectEXIFyer avoids that.

## What RectEXIFyer does

RectEXIFyer places your original photo into a target aspect ratio **without cropping it**.

You can:

- Embed images into common target formats (e.g. 1:1)
- Fill the remaining background area with:
  - a solid color **or**
  - a blurred version of the original image
- Add customizable frames around the main image
- Automatically extract and display essential EXIF data:
  - camera
  - lens
  - focal length
  - aperture
  - ISO (if available)

The goal is simple:  
**Your photo stays intact. The format adapts – not the other way around.**

## Why is this not Open Source?

RectEXIFyer is free to use, but not Open Source.
